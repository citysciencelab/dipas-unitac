# Addons

If there are any addons required to be added to the Masterportal those addons need to be cloned from the Addon repository to the ‘addons’ folder of the Masterportal before running the build process so that the addons will be incorporated into the build of the Masterportal.

The corresponding files which will be created during the build process for each addon need to be placed in:
*~\drupal\libraries\MasterportalAddons\\*.
