# Known Issues

- menu item "compare conceptions" cannot be renamed in the DIPAS GUI
- changing from one proceeding to another may cause an page loading error. This is due to too many redirects which causes the browser to stop it.
- on the content overview page content can be assigned to one or more proceedings. Content should not be assigned to more than one proceeding because changing the content will change it in all proceedings which may be unwanted
- changing the project admin menu orientation from horizontally to vertically will cause a complete loss of menu items
